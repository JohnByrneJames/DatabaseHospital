# DatabaseHospital
This is the OracleSQL files used to initialize and populate the planned database for the Hospital (Coursework Scenario). This was for the course 'Database applications' the task was the create a database that was suited to a newly implemented wristband system that they were incorporating. If you are interested in the scenario it can be downloaded here:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L8KRpYqsbyCisEk7v45ONrSfsIYHkmwd 

The Database was planned using Entity Relationship Diagrams on LucidChart.com this is where we created our conceptual diagram for the client and then the physical diagram for the final production of the system, everything has been changed to cater for the OracleSQL integration. After populating the database, I had to query the database in various ways to test if it was working correctly so that the end-user could use it in a specific way. The document I created can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ppYyBxRG8eQeyM5oJ6dP_dJB8qTkXGWA

If you are interested in downloading the database files then they are available in this repository.
